- How To Use -> Top Music Discovery Application
	- Enter the name of the artist you'd like to find top songs for
	- Hit the search button
	- Scroll side-to-side through the top ten songs by your favorite artist!

- NOTES:
	- Numerical Rankings are not listed on the screen anymore in the final version for aesthetic reasons.
		- Lines 49 and 66 in SongFragment.java are commented out. Uncomment these for the rankings to display
	- Program has been tested and debugged to account for API calling exceptions.
	- Program will work when rotated into landscape mode, and of course in portrait mode.
	- Stretch goals for saving and playing songs back were not implemented due to a Spotify premium account membership being required.
		- However I do intend to continue work on the project in order to include these features for those who have the neccesary accounts
